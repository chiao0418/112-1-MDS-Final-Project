## Project Introduction: Taipei Traffic Accident Hotspot Analysis
This project leverages government-source TDX data to identify high-risk traffic accident locations within Taipei City, utilizing a web-based, machine learning-powered platform. Built with Python's Flask framework, the system features a lightweight SQLite3 database for efficient data management. Users can interact with a Leaflet-powered graphical interface, visualizing accident hotspots on a map based on specific time periods. This allows for intuitive exploration of traffic patterns and the identification of dangerous road segments, ultimately aiming to enhance road safety through data-driven insights.
